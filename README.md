### Shell Completions

GitID supports shell completions for Bash, Zsh, and Fish to provide tab-completion for commands and arguments.

#### Installation

```bash
# Install for your current shell (auto-detected)
gitid completion bash    # For Bash
gitid completion zsh     # For Zsh  
gitid completion fish    # For Fish
```

#### Removal

```bash

gitid completion bash -r    # Remove Bash completions
gitid completion zsh -r     # Remove Zsh completions
gitid completion fish -r    # Remove Fish completions
```

After installation, restart your shell or source your configuration file (e.g., `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc`).

### Nicknames

Nicknames are optional short identifiers that make it easier to distinguish between identities:

- **Display**: Identities with nicknames show as `nickname (Name <email>)`
- **Without nicknames**: Shows as `Name <email>` (backwards compatible)
- **Adding nicknames**: Available when creating new identities or editing existing ones
- **Smart matching**: Future CLI will support switching by nickname, name, or email
